== Introduction
Customers would like to be able to configure EJB to use remote+tls protocol. This feature is already implemented in remoting but the configuration has to be added to jboss-ejb-client library and WildFly in order to make it work.

== Implementation

After the change users would be able to configure remote+tls protocol in remoting subsystem's remote-outbound-connection:

[source]
----
<subsystem xmlns="urn:jboss:domain:remoting:4.1">
   <http-connector name="http-remoting-connector" connector-ref="default" security-realm="ApplicationRealm"/>
   <outbound-connections>
      <remote-outbound-connection name="remote-ejb-connection" outbound-socket-binding-ref="binding-remote-ejb-connection" username="user1" security-realm="PasswordRealm" protocol="remote+tls">
   </outbound-connections>
   </subsystem>
----

== Test Plan

TBD


== Community Documentation
None
